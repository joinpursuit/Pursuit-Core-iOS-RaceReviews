1. sign out of the RaceReviews app 
1. delete the GoogleService-Info.plist from Xcode => “Move to Trash”
1. navigate to https://console.firebase.google.com/u/1/ , click on the RaceReviews app, then go to the **Project Settings** and download and drag your **GoogleService-Info.plist** to Xcode beneath the **Info.plist**

## Firebase Cocoapods used 

```
pod 'Firebase/Core'
pod 'Firebase/Auth'
pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
pod 'Firebase/Storage'
```

**Checklist**  
- [x] create the Xcode project
- [x] create firebase console project 
- [x] add google service plist file to xcode
- [x] add firebase sdk to the xcode project using cocoapods (firebase/core, /auth, /firestore, /storage)
- [x] confirm firebase installation in the firebase console after importing firebase into the Xcode project
- [x] add email/password authentication to the firebase project
- [x] create .xib login view
- [x] user can create an authenticated account using their email and password
- [ ] user is created in cloud firestore database after successfullly creating an account
- [x] present the race reviews tab controller if login is successful
- [x] architect login flow in the app delegate base on current user sign in state
- [x] user can sign out of the app 
- [x] present the login view controller when the user signs out
- [x] existing user can sign in to the app 
- [x] race review creation UI includes textfield to enter name and text view for review (firebase database)
- [ ] user can create a review (create)
- [ ] user can see an annotation on a MapView of their created review (read)
- [ ] user can udpate a review (only if userId == reviewerId) (update) 
- [ ] user can delete a review (only if userId == reviewerId) (delete) 

## Race Review Model 

```swift 
import Foundation
import CoreLocation

enum RaceType: CaseIterable {
  case swimming
  case biking
  case running
  case obstacle
  case other
}

struct RaceReview {
  let name: String
  let review: String
  let type: RaceType
  let lat: Double
  let lon: Double
  let reviewerId: String
  
  init(name: String, review: String, type: RaceType, lat: Double, lon: Double, reviewerId: String) {
    self.name = name
    self.review = review
    self.type = type
    self.lat = lat
    self.lon = lon
    self.reviewerId = reviewerId
  }
  
  init(dict: [String: Any]) {
    self.name = dict["name"] as? String ?? "no race name"
    self.review = dict["review"] as? String ?? "no race review"
    self.type = dict["type"] as? RaceType ?? .other
    self.lat = dict["lat"] as? Double ?? 0
    self.lon = dict["lon"] as? Double ?? 0
    self.reviewerId = dict["reviewerId"] as? String ?? "no reviewerId"
  }
  
  public var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D {
    return CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(lat, lon)
  }
}
```

## Cloud Firestore Security Rules 

**Test Mode: anyone with the Database Reference can read and write**   
```javascript
// Allow read/write access to all users under any conditions
// Warning: **NEVER** use this rule set in production; it allows
// anyone to overwrite your entire database.
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

**Locked Mode**  
```javascript 
// Deny read/write access to all users under any conditions
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

**Only signed in users can read, write**   
```javascript 
// Allow read/write access on all documents to any user signed in to the application
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Another common pattern is to make sure users can only read and write their own data:**   
```javascript 
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Make sure the uid of the requesting user matches name of the user
    // document. The wildcard expression {userId} makes the userId variable
    // available in rules.
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow create: if request.auth.uid != null;
    }
  }
}
