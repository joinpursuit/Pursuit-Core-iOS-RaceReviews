# Pursuit-Core-iOS-RaceReviews
RaceReviews uses the Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore database to create users. Authenticated users are able to add an annotation on a MapView along with a race review.

## Firebase Cocoapods used 

```
pod 'Firebase/Core'
pod 'Firebase/Auth'
pod 'Firebase/Firestore'
pod 'Firebase/Storage'
```

**Checklist**  
- [x] create the Xcode project
- [x] create firebase console project 
- [x] add google service plist file to xcode
- [x] add firebase sdk to the xcode project using cocoapods (firebase/core, /auth, /firestore, /storage)
- [x] confirm firebase installation in the firebase console after importing firebase into the Xcode project
- [x] add email/password authentication to the firebase project
- [x] create .xib login view
- [x] user can create an authenticated account using their email and password
- [x] user is created in cloud firestore database after successfullly creating an account
- [x] present the race reviews tab controller if login is successful
- [x] architect login flow in the app delegate base on current user sign in state
- [x] user can sign out of the app 
- [x] present the login view controller when the user signs out
- [x] existing user can sign in to the app 
- [x] race review creation UI includes textfield to enter name and text view for review (firebase database)

## Race Review Model 

```swift 
import Foundation
import CoreLocation

struct RaceReview {
  let name: String
  let review: String
  let type: String
  let lat: Double
  let lon: Double
  let reviewerId: String
  let dbReferenceDocumentId: String // reference to the race review document, useful for e.g deleting
  
  init(name: String, review: String, type: String, lat: Double, lon: Double, reviewerId: String, dbReference: String) {
    self.name = name
    self.review = review
    self.type = type
    self.lat = lat
    self.lon = lon
    self.reviewerId = reviewerId
    self.dbReferenceDocumentId = dbReference
  }
  
  init(dict: [String: Any]) {
    self.name = dict["raceName"] as? String ?? "no race name"
    self.review = dict["raceReview"] as? String ?? "no race review"
    self.type = dict["raceType"] as? String ?? "other"
    self.lat = dict["latitude"] as? Double ?? 0
    self.lon = dict["longitude"] as? Double ?? 0
    self.reviewerId = dict["reviewerId"] as? String ?? "no reviewerId"
    self.dbReferenceDocumentId = dict["dbReference"] as? String ?? "no dbReference"
  }
  
  // computed property to return a coordinate from the given lat and lon properties
  public var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D {
    return CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(lat, lon)
  }
}
```

## Cloud Firestore Security Rules 

**Test Mode: anyone with the Database Reference can read and write**   
```javascript
// Allow read/write access to all users under any conditions
// Warning: **NEVER** use this rule set in production; it allows
// anyone to overwrite your entire database.
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

**Locked Mode**  
```javascript 
// Deny read/write access to all users under any conditions
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

**Only signed in users can read, write**   
```javascript 
// Allow read/write access on all documents to any user signed in to the application
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth.uid != null;
    }
  }
}
```

**Another common pattern is to make sure users can only read and write their own data:**   
```javascript 
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Make sure the uid of the requesting user matches name of the user
    // document. The wildcard expression {userId} makes the userId variable
    // available in rules.
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, update, delete: if request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow create: if request.auth.uid != null;
    }
  }
}
```
